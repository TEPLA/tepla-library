 University of Tsukuba Elliptic Curve and Pairing Library
=============================================================

TEPLA(University of Tsukuba Elliptic Curve and Pairing Library) is a
free C library providing functions required to develop pairing based
cryptographis systems. The aim of TEPLA is to provide a library which
can be used in various platform.

TEPLA use GNU MP library and OpenSSL.

TEPLA provide following function

- Finite Field Arithmetic with 254-bit prime number
- Elliptic Curve Arithmetic on Barreto-Neahrig Curve.
- Pairing Arithmetic using Optimal Ate Pairing over BN Curve.
